## ðŸ›  Setup & Debugging Tips
- **Testing:**
    - cd backend
    - pytest
    - or pytest src/tests/*test_file.py*
    - do **not** add an _ _init_ _.py file to backend, or it will crash pytest
- **Installation on raspberrypi:**
    - probably just use "docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.rpi.yml up -d"

    - swap outcommented lines:
        - docker-compose: mongo image
        - database.py: client?
    - upload it to github
    - download project to raspberrypi
        - access raspberrypi via ssh: user and pw?
        - get some key from github to download it via ssh from the raspberry
        - donwload it
    - swap back lines and put it back on github
- **Debugging:**
    - uncomment 3 lines in the docker-compose file
    - choose "Attach to FastAPI (Docker)" in the vs code debugger
- **Common Issues:**
    - login data for the mongo express admin and pass (default)
